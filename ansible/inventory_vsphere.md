# Ansible Inventory with vSphere
* Inventory reference config
  https://github.com/joe-speedboat/linux.scripts/blob/master/ansible/inventory.vmware.yml

## Rundeck
The goal of this document is to provide an understanding of the possibilities and functionality of Rundeck and how Ansible got integrated.  
A RH294 (Ansible + RHCE) and practical experience with Rundeck are assumed as the basis for administration.

[Rundeck Website](https://www.rundeck.com/)  
[RH294 (Ansible + RHCE)](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/rh294-red-hat-linux-automation-with-ansible)

Rundeck is used to automate recurring tasks.  
This brings the following advantages:
-   Centralized management
-   WebUI with Active Directory authorization rules
-   Centralized scheduling for a better overview
-   Centralized error handling -\> eMail to Helpdesk -\> Zammad ticket
-   Centralized password management (Ansible Vault + Rundeck Vault)
-   Traceability of executed tasks (who, when, what, where)
-   Creating an autonomous and secure environment for the management of systems.

Honestly, creating jobs with Rundeck is very easy and pleasant.
However, administering Rundeck is not; it is complex and has many dependencies.
Rundeck should only be configured and maintained by someone who has experience and expertise.

### vCenter Inventory
* Inventory Script Config File: `rundeck@rundeck1:/etc/ansible/inventory/svvcenter1.vmware.yml`
  * Goals
    * Newly created VMs are discovered automatically
    * Without further definition, the VMs receive base configuration and updates
    * vSphere tags should make simple administration clear and efficient.
    * Excluded VMs are visible in the <code>ignore_tag</code> group
    * Systems temporarily in maintenance are visible in the <code>maintenance_tag</code> group
    * Groups can be composed from any vSphere objects

  * General

# Passwords

This section describes where passwords are stored and how they are
protected.

## Rundeck

Rundeck has a password vault. The passwords cannot be read by users,
but they can be referenced in jobs.

## Ansible Vault

Ansible Vault is a mechanism in which sensitive data can be stored in
encrypted files.  
When these encrypted files are used by Ansible, a password hidden at
runtime is used. This prevents the passwords from being exposed in a
backup.  
Therefore, this "Vault-Unlock Password" must be entered after every
startup.  
This is described in the Operations section.  
What Ansible Vault is and how it works is described [here
described](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/vault_guide/index.html),
the protected data is mainly stored here:  
`/etc/ansible/inventory/group_vars/`

# Operations

## Reboot

If the server is restarted, the Vault password must be entered via SSH:
```bash
ssh -l admin_XXXX svrundeck1.domain.tld
    sudo su -
        init-rundeck-and-ansible.sh
```
* More information about how this work is here
  https://github.com/joe-speedboat/linux.scripts/blob/master/ansible/vault-unlock.sh
  It is basically an unlock and a start of rundeck,nginx service
* `vim /usr/local/sbin/init-rundeck-and-ansible.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo
echo Feed the ssh private key passphrase for rundeck
echo "Bitwarden > vault@rundeck1"
echo "Link to Secret"
echo "https://v.domain.tld/#/vault?itemId=blub"

sudo -u rundeck --login echo
echo
echo INFO: re/starting rundeck + nginx service
systemctl restart rundeckd nginx
echo
echo
echo All done
echo Now login to rundeck webUI:
echo .Test the inventory
echo .Test AdHoc command
```

After that, the "Ansible Vault" is unlocked and the Rundeck service is
started.  

After Unlocking, it is recomended to verify access to target nodes once
* cli as rundeck user
  `ansible -m ping all`
