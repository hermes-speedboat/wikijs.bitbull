## Commonalities: Architecture and Workflow

All these frameworks share the same layered architecture. Messages enter via input channels (chat platforms, CLI, webhooks), then an Agent process gathers context (including the long-term Memory/Database), calls an LLM for planning, and optionally invokes Tools/APIs. The response is sent back through the output channels.

They typically support background schedules, memory (file- or SQL-based), and pluggable tools (web search, code execution, etc.).

The following diagram summarizes the pattern:

```mermaid
graph LR
  Chat["Chat Platforms"] --> Agent["AI Agent<br/>Orchestrator"]
  Agent --> LLM["Language Model<br/>LLM"]
  Agent --> Memory["Memory<br/>Database"]
  Agent --> Tools["External Tools<br/>APIs"]
  Memory --> Agent
  LLM --> Agent
  Tools --> Agent
  Agent --> Chat
```

A typical message flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant Channel
  participant Agent
  participant LLM
  participant Tool
  User->>Channel: Send command/text
  Channel->>Agent: Agent receives message
  Agent->>LLM: Request with context + memory
  LLM-->>Agent: Model response
  alt If an action is needed
    Agent->>Tool: Call external tool or command
    Tool-->>Agent: Result from tool
  end
  Agent->>Channel: Send response to user
```

These projects all allow fully self-hosted operation (e.g. on a Raspberry Pi, local server, or VM) and connect to chat platforms (Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, Discord, etc.) via official APIs or bridges. They use local config files or simple CLIs for setup, and most include built-in persistence for memory and tools integration. They differ in implementation language and emphasis: some target extreme efficiency (Rust/Go), others clarity (pure Python), and some emphasize security or container isolation.

**New trend – ACP (Agent Client Protocol):** An emerging standard for communication between AI agents and clients. Copilot CLI, Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pool, Gemini CLI and others all implement ACP, enabling interoperability between agents, IDEs, CI/CD pipelines, and multi-agent systems. See [Agent Client Protocol on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/agent-client-protocol).

## Conclusion

All Claw-style projects (and similar frameworks) share the same core concept: they are open-source, self-hosted agent assistants. They connect chat apps or CLI inputs to an LLM "brain" and extend it with real-world "hands" (tools and actions). The differences lie in their priorities and trade-offs:

- **Performance & Edge:** *ZeroClaw*, *PicoClaw* optimized for minimal footprint and fast startup on small hardware
- **Simplicity:** *Nanobot*, *MMClaw*, *LightAgent* offer small, clear codebases for easy customization or research use
- **Security:** *IronClaw* focuses on strict isolation of code and data (WASM, encrypted vaults)
- **Rich Features:** *OpenClaw* (~373k stars) and *Hermes Agent* (~155k stars) offer extensive integrations, multi-agent workflows, and self-improvement
- **Terminal Coding Agents:** *Claude Code* (~124k), *Codex CLI* (~83k), *OpenCode* (~13k), *Copilot CLI* (~11k) – the new breed of terminal-native coding agents, many implementing ACP for interoperability
- **ACP Standardization:** An emerging trend is the [Agent Client Protocol](https://github.com/topics/agent-client-protocol) (ACP) – implemented by Claude Code, Copilot CLI, Codex, OpenCode, Pool, Gemini CLI and others, enabling interoperability between agents, IDEs, CI/CD, and multi-agent systems

Despite varied languages (TypeScript/Node, Python, Rust, Go) and designs, they all implement the same loop:

`User message → Agent orchestrator → (LLM + context/memory) → (Optional tool invocation) → Response → User`

This architecture makes it possible to run personalized AI assistants on your own devices using models like GPT or Claude, extending them with automation capabilities.
