| Your Input                  | Meaning |
|------------------------------|---------|
| HELO Test                    | You identify yourself to the mail server using HELO. The server will respond with `250 OK` or a similar status message. |
| MAIL FROM:user@company.tld   | You specify the envelope sender address (MAIL FROM). This address can technically be spoofed. For testing, you may use your own email address. The receiving server must acknowledge with a 2xx status code. |
| RCPT TO:recipient@example.tld| You specify the valid recipient address where the message should be delivered. The mail server uses this information for routing. The server must confirm with a 2xx status code. |
| DATA                         | You indicate that the SMTP envelope is complete and that you will now send the message content (headers and body). The server responds with a 2xx or `354 Start mail input` status. |
| To: Testuser1                | Message header: logical recipient shown in the email client. |
| From: Testuser2              | Message header: logical sender shown in the email client (independent from MAIL FROM). |
| Subject: Testmail            | Message header: defines the email subject. |
| (empty line)                 | A blank line separates the message headers from the message body. |
| Test                         | Message body content. |
| .                            | A single dot on a new line terminates the DATA section and signals the end of the message content. The server should acknowledge acceptance with a 2xx status code. |
| QUIT                         | Terminates the SMTP session politely. |
