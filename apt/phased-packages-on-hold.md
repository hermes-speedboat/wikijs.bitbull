## Ubuntu packages held back due to unmet dependencies

* **Problem:** Not all packages on a system upgrade and are mentioned as held back

```
root@srvtestl12p:~# apt-get dist-upgrade
Reading package lists... Done

The following packages have been kept back:

## WHY

Updates are rolled out only to a subset of client machines (grouped by machine-id) to minimize impact in case of broken packages.

Example: If a broken package is rolled out with "phase for ex: 20%" and in the first week several clients report errors, the other 80% are not affected and the phased rollout gets stopped.

* There is a fix, see link (3) for Ubuntu 24.04 and later  
* https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/about-apt-upgrade-and-phased-updates  
* https://ubuntu-archive-team.ubuntu.com/phased-updates.html  
* https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/1988819  

## HOW TO GET RID OF

* `vim /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99no-phased-updates`

```
APT::Get::Always-Include-Phased-Updates "true";
```

The problem is that if you enable that, you always get "critical/buggy" updates first.  
Maybe that is not what you want.

## OUR SOLUTION / WAY TO GO

* We probably get affected by this issue when:
  * Moving repos from "public" to "Satellite/Foreman/local mirror"
  * Updating systems which have big gaps in software versions (not updated for a long period)

So we decided to:

```
echo 'APT::Get::Always-Include-Phased-Updates "true";' > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99no-phased-updates
apt-get clean all
apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade # must show held packages as upgradable
apt-get clean all
rm -fv /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99no-phased-updates
apt-get update
apt-get dist-upgrade # must show no packages
```

* To get informed about systems affected by this issue, we create a Rundeck job pointing to these systems.

## Down the rabbit hole

This phased update information is carried in the `Packages` files in the repository metadata.  
See example here:

```
curl -s http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/jammy-updates/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz | gunzip - | grep -e ^Phased -e Package: | grep -B1 ^Phased
Package: python3-update-manager
Phased-Update-Percentage: 0
--
Package: update-manager
Phased-Update-Percentage: 0
Package: update-manager-core
Phased-Update-Percentage: 0
```

* https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu-archive-tools/tree/phased-updater  

This script, running on package distribution systems, looks for bugs/heat-level and decreases the `Phased-Update-Percentage` if the heat-level rises. Otherwise, it increments the `Phased-Update-Percentage` step by step over time.
